# GitHub Desktop Diff Tests

This repository is intended to be used as a reference for exercising the diff engine in Desktop

As this repository is intended to be used as a reference, all content in this repository is licensed under a Creative Commons license. **Please keep this in mind and ensure you are permitted to publish this content if you are interested in contributing a test case.**

## Adding an test case

 1. Create a new folder following this convention - `[id]-[summary]`
   - `id` is the next available number based on previous tests cases in the repository
   - `summary` is a few words to describe the test case
   - examples: `0001-bitmap-image-support`, `0003-highlight-sections-in-line`
 2. In this new folder, craft the commits to demonstrate the issue (see below for more specific pointers)
 3. Add a `README.md` to the directory to summarize the test case, and attribute the owners of content (ensure their licenses permit reuse in this test suite).

## Crafting the image diff

The image diff test needs to use real images to ensure the test case is valid, so using public domain sources like [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) are ideal here if you need specific images.

## Crafting the text diff

**TODO**
